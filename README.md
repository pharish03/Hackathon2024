# `BudgetU` - clt-hackathon-2024 

Three computer science students from UNC Charlotte participated in their first-ever Hackathon, the CLT Hack Hackathon, held from April 5th to April 8th. Immersed in the challenge, we tackled the complexities of Express.js, a technology new to most of us, to develop a user-friendly financial website. Our aim was to serve individuals embarking on their banking or savings journey, infusing innovation and collaboration into every facet of our project.

## Description

The primary objective of our project was to empower users to set and track their savings goals, offering real-time progress updates and visual representations of their targets and transactions. Additionally, we aimed to deepen our proficiency in the Express.js framework, honing our skills with models, controllers, routes, and more. Despite the constraints of our timeline, we acknowledge the unfinished visual aids and commit to their completion by the end of May.
